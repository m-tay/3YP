Final Year Project, UEA Compsci: "AI and PCG in 3D games"

Project aims to implement Artificial Intelligence and Procedural Generation in a 3D game. 

Developed in Unity.

Implementation takes the form of a procedurally generated world, based on combining pre-built tiles into a maze. There is an algorithm to implement a guaranteed path through the maze and an algorithm to fill in the rest.

The game requires you to reach the exit. To make things more difficult (apart from the fact it's a maze), there is a terrifying scarecrow that will chase you if he spots you and kill you if he catches you.

To make things even more difficult, the maze is randomly re-generated behind you, so if you are forced to back-track because of the scarecrow, you will find the corridors and rooms different to the ones you just passed through.
