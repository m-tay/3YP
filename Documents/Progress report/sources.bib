abstract = {Abstract This paper presents a procedural approach to generate furniture arrangements for large virtual indoor scenes. The interiors of buildings in 3D city scenes are often omitted. Our solution creates rich furniture arrangements for all rooms of complex buildings and even for entire cities. The key idea is to only furnish the rooms in the vicinity of the viewer while the user explores a building in real time. In order to compute the object layout we introduce an agent-based solution and demonstrate the flexibility and effectiveness of the agent approach. Furthermore, we describe advanced features of the system, like procedural furniture geometry, persistent room layouts, and styles for high-level control.},
